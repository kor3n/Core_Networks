# Core Networks Libraries
Core Networks Libraries V1.0

## Requirements
* Python 3.6 +
* Netmiko
* ntc textfsm modules(included: Cisco, Palo) or write your own, https://github.com/networktocode/ntc-templates

## Reason
A Set of classes that work with Cisco & Palo devices to get initial connectivity.

This is to make it an OOP style of coding to be able to reference the libraries as imports so you don't have to write out code again repeating yourself...

Work smarter rather than harder...

## Usage
import & use as seen within `example.py`

## Future
More classes are going to be added and functions to go along as a base set.
